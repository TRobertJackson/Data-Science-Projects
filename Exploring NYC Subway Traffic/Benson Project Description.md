WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. There has been a significant drop in attendance at the last WTWY Gala. This will affect the direction and efficacy of WTWYâ€™s mission statement - that is unacceptable. 

We recently obtained NYC MTA data and would like to make a valuable contribution to increasing their overall membership rates.

Our data gives us insight into which stations and days of the week have the most foot-traffic - thus optimizing volunteer placement for outreach. Our analysis even highlights specific turnstiles within a station!

Furthermore, trends by week and time are readily available. Complimentary graphs for viewing pleasure.

Currently, we are in the process of combining census data with our findings to give further insight into the demographics of foot-traffic, that is to say, WTWY's future potential donors and members.
