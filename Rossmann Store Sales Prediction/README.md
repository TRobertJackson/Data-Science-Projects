# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis and XGBoost
The objective of this project was using Facebook Prophet (time series analysis) and XGBoost to forecast sales for Rossmann stores.

# Notebooks and Scripts

- [Rossmann Store Sales Prediction Master](https://github.com/tongwu21/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Rossmann%20Store%20Sales%20Prediction/Rossmann%20Store%20Sales%20Prediction%20Master.ipynb) - This notebook contains the final code for models.

- [Rossmann Store Sales Prediction Playground](https://github.com/tongwu21/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Rossmann%20Store%20Sales%20Prediction/Rossmann%20Store%20Sales%20Prediction%20Playground.ipynb) - This notebook contains the code that I used to explore data and play with models. 

- [Data Preparation Script](data_preparation.py) - a python script that was used to clean the data and add features.

- [Performance Evaluation Script](performance_evaluation.py) - a python script that was used to calculate RMSPE(root mean square percentage error).

- [XGBooost Prediction Script](xgboost_prediction.py) - a python script that contains the code for XGBoost. 

- [Prophet Prediction Script](prophet_prediction.py) - a python script that contains the code for Facebook Phophet model.

- [Plot Helper Script](plot_helper.py) - a python script that was used to plot forecasting results for Facebook Prophet model and XGBoost.
